## Project Name: Erasmus Application

## User Roles:
 1. Admin
 2. Student
 3. Instructor
 4. Coordinator
 5. Department Chairs
 6. International Student Office

## Summary of Application:
A web application aiming to provide ease of use to multiple user parties for the Erasmus application process will be developed. The application will provide target universities’ courses and their domestic counterparts at Bilkent University. Our application will automate the process of making placements and necessary adjusments if an application is withdrawn. Finally, our website will be a platform where all stakeholders will be able to communicate and fascilitate the process of Erasmus applications.

## What we will implement:
We will design a web application the users will have access to different interfaces based on their roles.

 - Admin user will have access to entire functionality of the application, therefore their interface will show
access logs, databases, user roles, etc.

 - Student role will be the primary role of the website, where they will be able to make new Erasmus applications 
to their desired choice of universities, track their applications and view related documents.

 - Instructors will be checking if the course load matches the syllabus, and will be approving student applications.

 - The coordinators will be screening the application processes and instructors will be confirming complementary courses 
with respect to their matching syllabuses.

 - Department chairs will manage and make the final confirmation of the applications.

 - International Student Office will manage incoming student applications..
